## FrameWork

Suppose there are 4-5 pages , But suppose some functionality like log in and log out to acess perticularpart of page,
are used in all pages that to solve it.

we can create comman component, whch has that data, all codes became complex and messy 

it is solved by  #Web-FrameWork

web-Frame work like rubyRails , django , ExpressJS , meteorJS , happieJS , koaJS, SailsJS

# Some Folder Structures OF NodeJs
MVC[ModelViewController], MV-VM[ModelView-ViewModel]

#MVC[ModelViewController] (Folder Structures)

Browser(user) localhost:/profile => Route(it will direct user to respective controller file by switch case)=>
=>Controller is a set / single funciÃ³n(Find HTML'JSON file) & by fs it read and send  back to Browser 

DataBase => IT s permanence storage to store data of all user
        [DB => both interact to each other <= Model]
Model=> we need some function to write that dataBase that are Model


# In this Course we are going to use MVC architecture Filder structure it is also use by PythonJango,RubyOnrails, ExpressJs , SailsJS.
