MVC[ModelViewController], MV-VM[ModelView-ViewModel]

#MVC[ModelViewController] (Folder Structures)

Browser(user) localhost:/profile => Route(it will direct user to respective controller file by switch case)=>
=>Controller is a set / single funciÃ³n(Find HTML'JSON file) & by fs it read and send  back to Browser 

DataBase => IT s permanence storage to store data of all user
        [DB => both interact to each other <= Model]
Model=> we need some function to write that dataBase that are Model


# In this Course we are going to use MVC architecture Filder structure it is also use by PythonJango,RubyOnrails, ExpressJs , SailsJS.

(some Template engines are: HandlebarsJS(HBS) , EJS, Pug , visit github.com/expressjs/express/wiki)

app.set('view engine' , 'ejs'); => It is use to SetUp template engine(EJS)

# STEPs for

3]set up views directory+file(folder)
4]we render using res.render ( extension is home.ejs)


# Locals :
Locals is an global object, your responce also an object with different keys , 
one of these key is Local , when i pass local.title in(file);
